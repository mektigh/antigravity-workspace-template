## 🔥 Killer Features

- 🧠 **Infinite Memory Engine**: Recursive summarization automatically compresses history. Context limits are a thing of the past.
- 🛠️ **Universal Tool Protocol**: Generic ReAct pattern. Just register any Python function in `available_tools`, and the Agent learns to use it.
- ⚡️ **Gemini Native**: Optimized for Gemini 2.0 Flash's speed and function calling capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development
1. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. **Run the Agent**:
    ```bash
    python src/agent.py
    ```

### Docker Deployment
1. **Build & Run**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

## 🚀 The "Zero-Config" Workflow

Stop writing long system prompts. This workspace pre-loads the AI's cognitive architecture for you.

### Step 1: Clone & Rename (The "Mold")
Treat this repository as a factory mold. Clone it, then rename the folder to your project name.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/study8677/antigravity-workspace-template.git my-agent-project
cd my-agent-project
# Now you are ready. No setup required.
```

### Step 2: The Magic Moment ⚡️
Open the folder in Cursor or Google Antigravity.
- 👀 **Watch**: The IDE automatically detects `.cursorrules`.
- 🧠 **Load**: The AI silently ingests the "Antigravity Expert" persona from `.antigravity/rules.md`.

### Step 3: Just Prompt (No Instructions Needed)
You don't need to tell the AI to "be careful" or "use the src folder". It's already brainwashed to be a Senior Engineer.

**Old Way (Manual Prompting)**:
> "Please write a snake game. Make sure to use modular code. Put files in src. Don't forget comments..."

**The Antigravity Way**:
> "Build a snake game."

The AI will automatically:
1. 🛑 **Pause**: "According to protocols, I must plan first."
2. 📄 **Document**: Generates `artifacts/plan_snake.md`.
3. 🔨 **Build**: Writes modular code into `src/game/` with full Google-style docstrings.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 1: Foundation** (Scaffold, Config, Memory)
- [x] **Phase 2: DevOps** (Docker, CI/CD)
- [x] **Phase 3: Antigravity Compliance** (Rules, Artifacts)
- [x] **Phase 4: Advanced Memory** (Summary Buffer Implemented ✅)
- [x] **Phase 5: Cognitive Architecture** (Generic Tool Dispatch Implemented ✅)
## 👥 Contributors

A massive thank you to the community members who help build this project:

- [@devalexanderdaza](https://github.com/devalexanderdaza) 💻 **(First Contributor!)**

## 💡 Call for Ideas: Swarm Protocol

We value **ideas** as much as code! 
We are currently brainstorming the architecture for **Phase 6: Multi-Agent Swarm**. If you provide a solid architectural suggestion or a detailed design that gets adopted, **you will be added to our README as a Contributor**.

Don't hesitate to share your thoughts in the [Issues](https://github.com/study8677/antigravity-workspace-template/issues), even if you don't have time to write the implementation.
