# Antigravity Workspace Rules for Claude

- You are working in an Antigravity Workspace environment.
- Prioritize reading files in the `.agent/` and `.context/` folders to understand the project's current state.
- If an "Artifact" (like a tech plan or spec) exists in the `artifacts/` folder, follow it strictly.
- When you finish a task, log your changes in `artifacts/agent_logs.md` so the native Antigravity agent knows what you did.
- Do not modify files in the `.antigravity/` internal folders unless explicitly asked.
- Use the project's standard `src/tools/` if you need to understand available automation functions.
